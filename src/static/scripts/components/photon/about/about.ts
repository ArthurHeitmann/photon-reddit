<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

<p>
	Photon does some very basic tracking. Collected data is stored on a private server and isn't shared with anyone.
	<br>
	Photon tracks events that are triggered by visiting a page. With an event the following data is associated:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A randomized user id. The id is in no way related to the username, ip or anything else. The id gets reset 
			after 30 days and a new one is generated. The new id is not related to the previous id
		</li>
		<li>
			The shortened page url. If the user visits /r/AskReddit/ then /r/AskReddit/ is tracked. 
			Anything after the 3rd slash will not be tracked. If the user visits /r/AskReddit/comments/iwedc5 then only 
			/r/AskReddit/ is tracked.
			<br>
			When Incognito Mode (not the Chrome feature) is enabled in the settings, regardless of the true url, only /i will be tracked.
		</li>
		<li>
			The referer is either the referer header when first visiting the website. On visiting internal links the 
			value of the previous shortened url is tracked. When in Incognito Mode an empty referer string will be tracked.
		</li>
		<li>
			The time in milliseconds in UTC.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	About once a week some user related data is reported. Data that is reported: browser support for a few modern features,
 	if and how much the user has customized the settings, how many posts were seen. The reported data is not correlated with the above-mentioned id. 
	<br>
	Tracking is disabled when Photon is running on localhost.
